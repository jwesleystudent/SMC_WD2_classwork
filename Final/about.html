                <p>The Lange Foundation (a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization) was founded in 1993 by Gillian Lange,
                    recipient of the 1980 City of Los Angeles St. Francis of Assisi award for her rescue work with
                    impounded animals since 1974. Lange founded the Amanda Foundation in 1975. To date the two
                    Foundations have rescued and placed over 27,000 cats, dogs and horses who would otherwise have been
                    destroyed in overcrowded public animal shelters. Lange and a group of dedicated staff and volunteers
                    works and will continue working everyday to help homeless animals.</p>

                <h3 id="amTitle">THE CHALLENGE</h3>
            
                <p>Every year in Los Angeles County, thousand of pets are taken to animal shelters simply because they
                    drastically outnumber the homes available to them. They spend their last few days in crowded cages
                    before many of them are euthanized. As their lives silently end, thousands more are being born who
                    will endure the same fate. The long-term answer to the overpopulation problem is to prevent the
                    births of pets who will never have homes and will only know misery during their short lives. We are
                    currently seeking funding to continue our efforts in the spay/neuter field. In the meantime, with
                    your help, we will do all we can to give a future to those who have already been born and abandoned
                    and need our help so desperately. We continue to do so until the day finally comes when animal
                    shelters will be what they were intended to be: a place of refuge.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aboutMain3">
                <h3 id="amTitle">THE ONES UNDER OUR CARE</h3>
                
                <p>The dogs we rescue come to us in all shapes, colors, sizes, and ages. Some are victims of abuse or
                    neglect. Others are starving strays. Some are purebred and some are obedience trained. Our hearts go
                    out to those who need surgery, spending their last few days of life in excruciating pain. We take as
                    many of them as we possibly can and our monthly surgery bills are overwhelming. The shelters
                    continue to be overcrowded with cats. The kittens have a better chance of adoption than adult cats.
                    Very few adults will ever find homes once they have entered the shelter system even though among
                    them are many purebreds. At the Lange Foundation, our cats await their new homes in a cage-free
                    environment. They are given the gift of time and if they are not adopted they will always have a
                    home with us. The horses under our care receive the same quality of care as our cats and dogs from
                    our dedicated Sanctuary staff and volunteers.</p>
