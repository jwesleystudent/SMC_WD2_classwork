        <div class="box red-bg lab-box-font"><P>Labradoodle. The Labradoodle is a cross between a Labrador Retriever and a Miniature or Standard Poodle. Like both of his parent breeds, he's intelligent, friendly, and at least moderately active. He has a shaggy or curly coat that requires maintenance.</P></div>

        <div class="box yellow-bg lab-box-font"><p>A Labradoodle is happiest when they're with the people they love, and they'll shower their family with affection and devotion. With the energy of the Labrador Retriever and the work ethic of both the Lab and the Poodle, they're a joy. They may soon end up as one of the most popular mixed breeds around.</p></div>

        <div class="box blue-bg lab-box-font">A Labradoodle approaches life head-on at breakneck speed, and they approach every new friend with the same enthusiasm. With training, however, you can teach your Labradoodle proper doggy etiquette. A Labradoodle is generally easy to train, since they're intelligent and eager to please.</div>
